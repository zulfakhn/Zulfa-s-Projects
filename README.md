## Overview
This is my 12th assignment in learning the HTML and CSS modules in Skodev. The website I created is a personal portfolio website that showcases my work and skills as a digital marketing, with specific focus areas including KOL (Key Opinion Leader), Creative Production, and Content Writing. The website is divided into three main pages: Home, Projects, and Collaborations.

## Pages

### 1. Home
The Home page introduces me and my role in digital marketing. It contains:
- **Introduction**: A brief introduction about my name and my job role.
- **Explore My Service**: Highlights of my previous works and roles I have undertaken.
- **Profile Section**: Insight into the skills I will perform as a digital marketer.
- **Collaboration Benefits**: An overview of what potential collaborators can gain by working with me.

### 2. Projects
The Projects page showcases a comprehensive collection of my work. It is divided into three categories:
- **KOL (Key Opinion Leader)**: Projects and campaigns where I have served as a Key Opinion Leader.
- **Creative Production**: Examples of creative production projects.
- **Content Writing**: A portfolio of my favorite written content, articles, and copywriting work.

### 3. Collab
The Collab page is designed for potential collaborators who wish to work with me. It includes:
- **Collaboration Form**: This page contains a CTA so prospective clients can collaborate, and a form must be filled out by parties who propose collaboration and projects.

## What I Made
I created a personal portfolio website to showcase my digital marketing skills and projects. This website includes three main pages: Home, Projects, and Collab. Each page highlights different aspects of my work and provides a platform for potential collaborators to get in touch.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Design**: Ensure consistent and visually appealing design across pages, especially so that it can be viewed well on mobile devices.
2. **Form Integration**

## How I Overcame the Challenges
1. **Design**: I use Figma as a design tool to maintain a consistent layout and style across all pages. I also created a style guide to ensure uniformity in fonts, colors, and spacing.
3. **Form Integration**: I'm looking for a tutorial on creating a form that can be connected to Gmail on YouTube. Then I combined the learnings I learned in Skodev and on YouTube to create a functional collaboration form.
